Adding Music And Sound Effects
==============================

-  In the data/music folder add your mp3 (for music) and wav (for sound
   effects) files. (Create the folder if it doesnâ€™t exist.)
-  Open data/game/music.json
-  Add your music and sound effect entries there with a given name and
   their path.

Example of music.json

.. code:: json

   {
       "Music": "data/music/music.mp3",
       "Sound": "data/music/sound.wav"
   }
